Before you can use this, you need to create the config.py file to the top folder.

config.py:
    STATIC_FOLDER = 'static'
    DEBUG = True
    SECRET_KEY = '' #Add a secret key string here
    FLASK_ADMIN_SWATCH = '' #Add a admin swatch string here
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///database.sqlite'
    SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT = '' #Add a salt number here
    SECURITY_REGISTERABLE = True
    SECURITY_SEND_REGISTER_EMAIL = False
    NAME = '' #Add your name
    EMAIL = '' #Add your email
    PHONE_NUMBER = '' #Add your phone number
    DEFAULT_IMAGE_PATH = 'website/static/ProjectDefaultPic.svg'

Then run in the command prompt:

    python -m venv venv

to create a virtual inviroment.
if this doesn't work, you need to install python on your pc first.

then run:

    . venv/bin/activate    # Linux MacOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

now your virtual inviroment is set up.

Now you need to install the requirements by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

then you need to create the database by running:

    python create_db.py

now you can run the website:

    python run.py
